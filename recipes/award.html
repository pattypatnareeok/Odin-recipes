    <h1>Award Winning Soft Chocolate Chip Cookies</h1>

    <img src="https://www.allrecipes.com/thmb/FL9CXP3hwOqfz7Xrr4Z8BDiAhpI=/2250x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4533707-215c8b63f7ba4fd697a210343739c5f8.jpg" alt="cookies">
    
    <p> This recipe made perfectly soft chocolate chip cookies. The dough is made with two packets of instant pudding mix — an ingredient I had never seen anyone use in cookie dough — which seems to give the cookies a softer, more bakery-style texture. Think of these as the "soft-baked" style cookies that have a somewhat pliable, bendy texture. </p>
    <p> But the most important thing to note about this recipe is that it makes a lot of cookies (six dozen to be exact!). This makes it an ideal recipe to whip up if you're baking for a large group, but not the best option if you're baking for just a few people. That said, you can pre-scoop the cookie dough onto a sheet tray, freeze the dough balls, then transfer them into zip-top bags and stash them in the freezer for later. </p>
