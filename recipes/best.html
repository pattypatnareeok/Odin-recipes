    <h1>The Overall Best Chocolate Chip Cookie Recipe: Best Chocolate Chip Cookies</h1>
    <p>This recipe was hands down my favorite of the bunch. It made classic chocolate chip cookies that were a cinch to whip up and absolutely delicious. Equal amounts of brown and white sugars give them a classic chewy-yet-crisp texture while half a teaspoon of salt balances out the sweetness. Chopped walnuts giive the cookies a pop of texture that I really enjoyed, although you could easily leave them out. I loved the simplicity of this recipe and would happily make them again.</p>
